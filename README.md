# Mutimodal-Hate-Speech-Detection-System
 The multimodal hate speech detection system predicts if a comment or meme contains hate speech. It classifies text as targeted or untargeted and directed at individuals or groups. For images, it detects hate and categorizes them into blood and gore, NSFW, or smoking. This approach handles both text and images for accurate hate speech detection.
