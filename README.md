# Mutimodal-Hate-Speech-Detection-System
This project implements a multimodal hate speech detection system capable of classifying both text comments and memes (images) to identify hate speech. The system distinguishes between targeted and untargeted hate speech and can identify whether it is directed at individuals or groups. For images, it categorizes content into specific classes such as blood and gore, NSFW (Not Safe for Work), or smoking.
# Introduction
The rise of online platforms has made it increasingly important to monitor and control hate speech, which can harm individuals and communities. This system combines text and image analysis to provide a comprehensive approach to detecting hate speech in various formats.

# Requirements
Software
Python 3.x
Libraries:
TensorFlow or PyTorch
NLTK or spaCy (for text processing)
OpenCV or PIL (for image processing)
scikit-learn (for machine learning utilities)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Hardware
A computer with a capable GPU (recommended for training deep learning models)
Sufficient storage for datasets and models
# System Architecture
The system consists of two primary modules:

Text Classification Module: Analyzes comments to classify them as:

Targeted or untargeted
Directed at individuals or groups
Image Classification Module: Processes memes and classifies them into:

Blood and gore
NSFW
Smoking
Both modules feed into a central decision system that combines the results for final hate speech detection.

# Data Collection
Text Data
Use publicly available datasets containing labeled comments, such as:
Twitter datasets on hate speech
Online forums or social media platforms (ensure compliance with their terms)
Image Data
Collect memes from social media, ensuring to label images based on the categories mentioned above.
Use existing datasets of hateful images where available.
Preprocessing
Clean and tokenize text data.
Resize and normalize images for consistent input to models.
# Model Training
Text Classification:

Utilize models such as BERT, LSTM, or CNNs for text analysis.
Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
Image Classification:

Implement CNN architectures like ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet for image analysis.
Augment the dataset to improve model robustness.
Training Process:

Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.
Monitor training with validation data to prevent overfitting.
